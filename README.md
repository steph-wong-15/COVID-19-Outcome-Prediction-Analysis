# COVID-19 Outcome Prediction Analysis
COVID-19 is a disease that has impacted hundreds of millions of people worldwide. The
symptoms may range from mild to life threatening and that is due to various factors. The focus of
our analysis is to predict the outcome of COVID patients based on a patientâ€™s characteristics
such as age, sex, and so on. We created machine learning models that used select features to
predict the outcome of a person who has been infected by COVID.
